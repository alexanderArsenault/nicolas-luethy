          My interests include music, sport (football, exploring new
          technologies and organising Music and wine events. I'm a part of a
          collective which organizes concerts and parties in different venues
          around Zurich. While studying in Bordeaux, I was a part of the Vinseec
          Wine Association which helped me discover my new hobby, organizing
          tasting events around Zurich.
